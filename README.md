:bulb: MEAN stack application: 

MongoDB :octocat: NODE :octocat: EXPRESS :octocat: ANGULAR

Work in progress, feel free to come up with ideas.

Idea of project:

This should end up, with a boilerplate for nodeJS, expressJS and angularJS, with an API that manages Users and Content.

For authentication @passport is used.

workaround passport: Frontend authentication will be users validation on inputs, so it don't have to it twice as in the backend. [password, passwordConfirm]

backend will look if the user is authenticated to get api request with passport.
